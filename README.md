A personal project to create habits, constructing chains of initerrupted tasks and keeping tracking of them.

For now it's really just a scractch of the idea, i.e. no good practices involved haha. Just an idea popped out of my head and I had to code.

It will be powered by Vue.js, but I'm still deciding where to store the data: `localStorage` to work just on my PC or an third-party API (Google Tasks seems like a good fit for now).
